Add Target
- Before Launching any scan, users should add target. The system takes domain name as a target. In addition, users can also add short description about the domain, but this is totally optional.

List Targets
- Once we have added the target, we need to check if the target was added successfully or not by navigating to list targets page. This page displays all the previously added targets along with additional information such as Added Date, Last Scanned date, and action column. From action column, we can either delete the target or Launch scan.

In addition, we can also remove the target from scan history list from the action section. Moreover, to view the detailed scan result, we should click on view button.
